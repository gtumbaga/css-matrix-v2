# CSS Matrix V2

This is simple HTML and CSS that can be used as a screen saver.
You simply need to find a screen saver that lets you use web pages as the screen saver.

Note:
This is v2 of this code.  V1 moved the entire code column down, but I didn't like this.
True matrix code, the text itself doesn't slide, but it's appearance fades in and out
as a column.
